<p>Sinikiwe Dhliwayo Wants to Make Yoga More Accessible (and Affordable) For Black People</p>

<p>For so long, mainstream media has fed us an image of what a “yogi” is supposed to be—a skinny, athletic, affluent white woman dressed in head-to-toe Lululemon. Just do a Google image search of “yoga” and count how many people of color you see (even though the practice originated in ancient India).</p>
<p>Like many other women of color, I've stayed away from the yoga community out of fear of feeling like “the other” and occupying spaces that were not made for us or by us. So how do you engage in the practice of yoga when you don’t necessarily fit the description? You create your own space. And lately, a wealth of people of color have made it their mission to cultivate safe, welcoming spaces for black people to experience yoga and practice self-care. Naaya is one of them.</p>

<p>Naaya is the brainchild of Sinikiwe Dhliwayo, a photo producer at Men's Health by day and yoga instructor on the weekends. Dhliwayo was first introduced to yoga by her mother, but didn't know or see anybody else she recognized attending the classes. "I kept asking myself, 'Why aren’t there students of color?' It was difficult just being in these spaces like yes, I’m here for myself and I’m here to practice yoga but it would still be nice to see someone like me doing yoga because I know the interest is there," she tells ELLE.com. "Who wants to spend $25, $30 a pop on a class to feel uncomfortable?"</p>

<p>Why did you create Naaya?</p>
<p>
I found myself going to studios that would focus on a specific type of yoga, like hip-hop yoga or whatever, and yes, the beats were bumping but there were no teachers of color or people of color in the class. I kept asking myself, "Why aren’t there students of color?" There are people out there that have interest in doing yoga and have the money to spend. Who wants to spend $25, $30 a pop on a class to feel uncomfortable?</p>

<p>With Naaya, I think the big mission is to have classes with myself and other teachers of color and just make them financially accessible. Also, having classes in cool spots that aren't the traditional yoga studio setting, maybe doing it outside or doing it on a rooftop.</p>

<p>Walk me through one of your Saturday classes.</p>
<p>So we do proper technique, breathing. Some poses that we do are: sun salutation A, sun salutation B and then maybe throw in some poses like half moon, boat, dancer pose, retreat pose--very basic poses. I modify the class based off of who is in the room, so if there's a beginner, we'll do sun salutation b with a few simple sequences in the middle and then end in the resting pose.</p>

<p>How did you incorporate your Zimbabwe culture into your yoga practice?</p>
<p>Shona is the language spoken in Zimbabwe and Naaya itself means healing, which I think just fit so perfectly with the message I wanted to send. I definitely think yoga heals hearts in the end.</p>

<p>In what ways have you seen your life change since you started doing yoga?</p>
<p>I have control over my life now, to an extent. I just started going to therapy and while it took me a while to even get to this point, I know it's something that I need.</p>
